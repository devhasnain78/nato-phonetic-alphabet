# nato-phonetic-alphabet

===================================

A Python application that converts words into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent. This project demonstrates dictionary data structures, list comprehensions, and user input handling.

Features
--------

Takes a user-input word and converts each letter into its corresponding NATO phonetic code (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.). Handles both uppercase and lowercase inputs gracefully. Provides clear output showing the phonetic representation of the entire word. Includes error handling for non-alphabetic characters with user-friendly prompts.
